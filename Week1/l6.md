* **Dendrites:** receive signals from other neurons.
* **Soma** processes the signals.
* **Axon** transmits the output signal to other neurons.
* **Synapses** are the connections between neurons.

* Biological neurons are the inspiration for artificial neurons, which are the fundamental units of artificial neural networks.
* Artificial neurons are designed to mimic the information processing capabilities of biological neurons in the brain.

## **How Neurons Work**

* Our senses interact with the outside world, sending signals to the brain.
* A single neuron receives signals from sensory organs, processes them, and decides whether to take an action.
* If the neuron is excited enough, it fires an action potential, sending a signal to other neurons.
* The brain is a massive network of interconnected neurons arranged in layers.
* Information flows from one layer of neurons to another, with each layer performing some level of processing.
* The visual cortex is an example of a brain region with multiple layers that process visual information.
* Each layer of the visual cortex performs a specific task, such as detecting edges, features, or objects.
